Coins.
i) Write a class to represent a coin that can be flipped to show either heads or tails (you
do not need to represent the value of the coin). Your class should include a suitable
attribute (this could be a simple boolean, an integer value, a character, or any other
suitable type for representing the two values), a constructor that randomly initialises the
object to either heads or tails, a method that can be called to "flip" the coin (randomly
setting it to either heads or tails), a method to tell whether the coin is showing heads, and
a toString method that returns "Heads" or "Tails".

ii) Write a test/client program that creates a new coin object and flips it a few times,
printing its value each time, to check that your new class is working correctly. Then,
modify your test program so that it flips the coin 10 000 times counting how many times
it shows heads and how many times tails, and reports the results. What answers do you
expect?
